          <p class="projects-text">Alliance Bernstein requested a new micro-site for their private client events division. I worked closely with the AB design and digital marketing department to develop a simple, but beautiful interface in compliance with the AB identity. Some of the UX elements were based on Twitterâ€™s front- end-framework, Bootstrap. The website was developed using Bootstrap as well.</p>
