          <p class="projects-text">I got involved with the Diaspora Foundation after reading an article that described the work the organization performs with at-risk-youth in the Colombian municipality of Soacha. As part of their digital strategy, I develop a new logo and identity that conveys the nature of the organization. Moreover, a wordpress site was launched with a customized theme.</p>
